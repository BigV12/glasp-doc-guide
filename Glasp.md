# What is Glasp?

Glasp is a web browser extension that allows you to highlight any content on a web page on the Internet. Glasp is not restricted to only texts but you can also use it to highlight videos and images on various web pages.

Glasp stores these highlights for you and keeps them so you can easily access them or make reference to them at a later time.

![Glasp home](<Screenshot%20(145).png>)

Glasp solves the problem 'bookmarking' a web page creates. Bookmarking a web page can be tasking. when you bookmark a web page, you might not even know where the exact text you are interested in is on the webpage. Also, you can't arrange your bookmarks orderly, add comments and notes about them, or use tags to group them.
This makes accessing texts on bookmarked or saved web pages difficult.

Glasp solves these problems. With Glasp you can highlight a particular text in an article and Glasp stores not only the text you highlighted but also keeps the URL of the webpage where the text is gotten from so you can revisit it at a later time. And when you revisit the webpage, you will still see the highlighted text on the web page
